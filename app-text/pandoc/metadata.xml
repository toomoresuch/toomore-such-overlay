		Pandoc is a Haskell library for converting from one markup
		format to another, and a command-line tool that uses
		this library. It can read markdown and (subsets of)
		reStructuredText, HTML, LaTeX and Textile, and it can write
		markdown, reStructuredText, HTML, LaTeX, ConTeXt, Docbook,
		OpenDocument, ODT, RTF, MediaWiki, Textile, groff man pages,
		plain text, Emacs Org-Mode, EPUB, and S5 and Slidy HTML
		slide shows.
		
		Pandoc extends standard markdown syntax with footnotes,
		embedded LaTeX, definition lists, tables, and other
		features. A compatibility mode is provided for those
		who need a drop-in replacement for Markdown.pl.
		
		In contrast to existing tools for converting markdown
		to HTML, which use regex substitutions, pandoc has
		a modular design: it consists of a set of readers,
		which parse text in a given format and produce a native
		representation of the document, and a set of writers,
		which convert this native representation into a target
		format. Thus, adding an input or output format requires
		only adding a reader or writer.
