		This package contains definitions for the &#39;Pandoc&#39; data
		structure, which is used by pandoc to represent
		structured documents.  These definitions used to live
		in the pandoc package, but starting with pandoc 1.7, they
		have been split off, so that other packages can use them
		without drawing in all of pandoc&#39;s dependencies, and
		pandoc itself can depend on packages (like citeproc-hs)
		that use them.
		
		@Text.Pandoc.Builder@ provides functions for building
		up @Pandoc@ structures programmatically.
		
		@Text.Pandoc.Generic@ provides generic functions for
		manipulating Pandoc documents.
