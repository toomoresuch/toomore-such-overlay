		Parsec is designed from scratch as an industrial-strength parser
		library.  It is simple, safe, well documented (on the package
		homepage), has extensive libraries and good error messages,
		and is also fast.  It is defined as a monad transformer that can be
		stacked on arbitrary monads, and it is also parametric in the
		input stream type.
